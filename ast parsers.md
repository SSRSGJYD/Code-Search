## AST Parsers of Python & JavaScript

### Python

1. `ast` module in python library

documentation: https://docs.python.org/3/library/ast.html



2. `typed-ast` : a third-party package

> typed_ast is a Python 3 package that provides a Python 2.7 and Python 3
> parser similar to the standard ast library.  Unlike ast, the parsers in
> typed_ast include PEP 484 type comments and are independent of the version of
> Python under which they are run.  The typed_ast parsers produce the standard
> Python AST (plus type comments), and are both fast and correct, as they are
> based on the CPython 2.7 and 3.6 parsers.
