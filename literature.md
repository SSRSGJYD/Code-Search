Question1: 

In section 7.3, it is mentioned that it is of no meaning to compare between different PLs, since training corpora varies in size and PLs vary in characteristic. So how could the point that 'performance on C and Python is at least as good as Java' be drawn, which is also mentioned in section 7.3 ?
